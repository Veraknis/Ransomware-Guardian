Agriculture is the backbone of our community. Tripp County is the largest cattle producer in South Dakota. Our farmers & ranchers also harvest a great deal of wheat and corn. Our open prairies and rolling hills provide an excellent habitat for a sportsman's paradise. Winner is known for top-notch pheasant hunting. Deer, turkey, prairie dogs, grouse, prairie chicken, dove, and coyotes are also hunted in the area. The Winner Youth Fishing Pond is a wonderful way to spend the afternoon fishing. Should you desire to fish on the Missouri River, it is a scenic 30 mile drive.\r\n\r\nA couple of unique landmarks to Winner are Leahy Bowl and the Winner Drive-In Theatre. If you happen to visit Winner in the summer, you will not be disappointed with the events at each of these attractions. The Winner Drive-In Theatre is one of very few Drive-Ins left in the USA. Leahy Bowl hosts many baseball games each summer and is well preserved by the community.\r\n\r\nWe have many events year-round and Labor Day is our big celebration.
