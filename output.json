Salesforce had a duty of care, of implementing reasonable security measures to prevent these simple data breaches. Salesforce was provided the intelligence of the attacks taking place, the time and opportunity to make a reasonable effort to prevent these attacks. Considering that these attacks took place over many months, we believe that you have been criminally negligent to these attacks taking place.\r\n\r\nOur documentation will be directly provided to the UNITED STATES DISTRICT OF NORTHERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA, we will engage in open dialogue with our press contacts, civil/commercial litigation lawyers, and answering any questions asked.\r\n\r\nAs you have likely been informed by your lawyers.

Very easily and swiftly.\r\n\r\nTo reiterate, we have full access to your systems, should the ransom demand not be met, your data will be released in full.\r\n\r\nShould you comply, we will withdraw from any active or pending negotiation indiviually from your customers.
